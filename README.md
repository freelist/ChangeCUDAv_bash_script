# ChangeCUDAv_bash_script
A little utility script for checking and switching rapidly your current CUDA version.

## Usage
This script basically check and ask for switching among your current CUDA installed versions.

** Warning ** This only works if you have created the symbolic link from /usr/local/cuda to one of your CUDA versions. If not, it will check for all the versions and at the end it will create it. This script essentially does this switching but in a more fashion way! :P
